# project2-Build-a-ML-Workflow-for-Scones-Unlimited-on-Amazon-SageMaker
This project was created as the result of an activity I developed when I was attending to the course 'Developing your First ML Workflow' of Udacity's AWS Machine Learning Nanodegree program.

The project use a sample dataset called CIFAR to simulate an image classification model. I deploy and monitor a machine learning workflow for Image Classification using AWS resources such as, sagemaker and boto3 SDKs, image-classification built-in algorithm, Lambda functions and Step Function Workflow, and SageMaker model monitor and endpoint. The CIFAR dataset is open source and can be downloaded at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-100-python.tar.gz

The project include the files:

1) 'starter.ipynb' notebook file with complete solution and key results displayed;

2) Step Function in 'MyStateMachine-project2.json';

3) Four screenshots of the working Step Function;

4) and the Lambda functions as 'Lambda.py' file

It was my first time using AWS platform and the result of this project is very simple nevertheless the content is very rich and insightful.
